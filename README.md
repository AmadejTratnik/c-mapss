Reading an article *Damage Propagation Modelling for Aircraft Engine Run-to-Failure Simulation* and trying to make a fault detection pipeline of a jet engine, with the help of C-MAPPS dataset and reccurent neural networks.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
4 Datasets (FD001-4) consist of multiple multivariate series. Each dataset has 3 operational settings and number of sensor measurements which are contaminated with noise over time.
