# Exploratory Data Analysis
4 Datasets (FD001-4) consist of multiple multivariate series. Each dataset has 3 operational settings and number of sensor measurements which are contaminated with noise over time.

Taking a look at example of sensor measurements, we can see non-linear trends in some, caused by noises in sensors.
